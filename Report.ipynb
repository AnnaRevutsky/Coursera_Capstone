In 2017, Seattle police reported 10,959 motor vehicle collisions on city streets. According to the report, in 2017 there were a total of 187 fatal and serious injury collisions on Seattle streets.

    "In this study, I analyzed the relationship between collisions severity and weather, road, light conditions, junction type and number of people involved in collisions. I identified collision type, junction type among the most important features that affect a collision severity. I built classification models to predict severity and probability collisions. These models can be very useful for transportation and logistics companies, people who travel by car, taxi drivers, ordinary car drivers in reducing risk of collisions, property damage and people death."

    "I was able to achieve ~68% accuracy in the classification problem. However, there was still significant variance that could not be predicted by the models in this study. I think the models could use more or other features as speeding, car make, car conditions etc. For example, bad car conditions or old car model may be less secure than anew one at good conditions with many sensors and even auto pilot function that helps to prevent a collision or reduce severity. More data, especially data of different address types of collision, influencing factors on a driver would help improve model performances.\n"
